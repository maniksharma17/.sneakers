#### Description: My final project for Harvard CS50 is a  “front-end only” sneaker website named “.sneakers”. I used html, css, and javascript DOM manipulation to bring my imagination into reality.  I developed this as part of my web development learning journey to enhance my front-end and designing skills.

> The e-commerce website is just a design sample and not a fully functional sneaker store.

> The ultimate sneaker paradise!
